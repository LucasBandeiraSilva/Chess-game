## Java Chess Game

This is a console-based chess game implemented in Java, incorporating object-oriented programming principles learned throughout the course. 

**Features:**

*   **Core Chess Logic:** Implements all standard chess rules, including:
    *   Piece movement and capture
    *   Check and checkmate detection
    *   Stalemate
    *   Special moves:
        *   **En passant** 
        *   **Castling** (both kingside and queenside)
        *   **Pawn Promotion**

*   **OOP Principles:**
    *   **Encapsulation:** Data hiding and controlled access through methods.
    *   **Inheritance:**  Chess pieces are organized using inheritance from abstract classes.
    *   **Polymorphism:**  Different piece types override movement and behavior methods. 

**Note:** This project does not include a graphical user interface (GUI) and is played via the console.

**How to Play (Console):**

1.  Compile and run the main application class.
2.  The game will be displayed in the console, showing the board and prompting the current player for a move.
3.  Input moves using standard algebraic notation (e.g., "e2 e4" to move the King's pawn two squares forward). 
4.  The game will continue until a player is checkmated.

This project was primarily for educational purposes to practice and demonstrate understanding of OOP concepts in Java.
